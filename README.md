## AI Model to Recommend Trademark Class
This code demonstrates the development of an AI model that recommends a trademark class for a product or service entered by the user. The model is trained using a large dataset of existing goods and services from the USPTO ID Manual.

The code uses the following techniques:

Loading and preprocessing of the input data using Tokenization and Padding techniques
Training the neural network using a sequential model with a single hidden layer of 64 neurons and softmax activation function for the output layer
Evaluation of the model using Test Loss and Test Accuracy metrics
Prediction on the test data and calculation of Precision, Recall, and F1-score using scikit-learn library
Saving the trained model to disk
The input data is stored in a JSON file and loaded into the script using the json library. The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. The target variable is converted to integers using LabelEncoder and then to one-hot encoding using to_categorical function from tensorflow.keras.utils.

The input text is preprocessed using Tokenization and Padding techniques provided by tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text and tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence modules. The vocabulary size and maximum sequence length are set to 5000 and 100 respectively.

The neural network architecture consists of a single hidden layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation function. The output layer has a softmax activation function to output class probabilities. The model is compiled using categorical_crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 16.

After training, the model is evaluated on the test data using Test Loss and Test Accuracy metrics. Then, the model is saved to disk for later use. Finally, the model is used to make predictions on the test data and Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated using scikit-learn library.

This code can be used as a starting point for building a more complex AI model for recommending trademark classes using various NLP techniques like cosine similarity, word embeddings, and more.
